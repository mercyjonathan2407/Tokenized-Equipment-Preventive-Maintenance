# Tokenized Equipment Preventive Maintenance

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based system for managing preventive maintenance of industrial equipment through tokenization. By creating digital representations of physical assets and their maintenance requirements, this solution enables transparent, auditable, and efficient equipment maintenance management across organizational boundaries.

## Core Components

### Asset Registration Contract
- Creates unique digital representations of industrial machinery and equipment
- Records essential asset details including make, model, serial number, and specifications
- Maintains ownership history and transfer records
- Stores technical documentation and manufacturer guidelines
- Enables equipment tokenization for maintenance tracking and verification

### Maintenance Schedule Contract
- Defines required service intervals based on manufacturer recommendations
- Creates smart preventive maintenance schedules for each tokenized asset
- Generates automatic maintenance notifications and reminders
- Adjusts maintenance requirements based on usage patterns and environmental factors
- Implements rule-based schedule modifications for special operating conditions

### Technician Verification Contract
- Validates qualified service providers and technicians
- Manages certification records and specialized qualifications
- Verifies technician authorization for specific equipment types
- Tracks technician performance and maintenance history
- Ensures appropriate skill matches for maintenance tasks

### Compliance Tracking Contract
- Monitors adherence to established maintenance plans
- Records service history with immutable timestamps and verification
- Generates compliance reports for regulatory requirements
- Alerts stakeholders to missed or delayed maintenance
- Provides auditable proof of maintenance for warranty and insurance purposes

## Benefits
- Reduces equipment downtime through proactive maintenance
- Extends asset lifecycle with proper preventive care
- Creates transparent service history for equipment resale value
- Improves regulatory compliance with automated documentation
- Optimizes maintenance resource allocation through data-driven insights
